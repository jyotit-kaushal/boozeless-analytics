This place caught my attention with its cool black modern signboard affixed just below an oriental style roof flanked by thick foliage. This East meets West element is done very well, enticing me to take a peek at what's beyond the entrance. And wow, a nice courtyard that is perfect for party and mingling, an idyllic porch and a classy interior.\n\nSince I also like what's on the menu, I shelve aside my original dining plans and have a nice lunch here. And I made the right choice since the food, the wine and the service here are awesome.\n\nGrilled Pork Secreto is so succulent with a nice layer of fat for the buttery richness. This richness is zested up by the lovely pungent aroma of the herbs in Chimichurri Butter. The accompanying Lyonnaise Potatoes is grilled to perfection where the smoky flavour enhance the taste of the potato. They are so delicious. This is one of those few times where I'm absolutely like the potatoes. The accompanying grilled onion is oh-so-sweet that I finish every strand of it. Highly recommend.\n\nJoselito Iberico Ham, with its beautiful marbling of omega-rich fats, is lightly salted and firm in texture. When chewing on it, the complex flavours of the cured meat and fats released once again cement in my mind that this ham is one of the best hams. Parma Ham doesn't even come close. Unlike most hams with strong taste, this Iberico Ham holds subtle flavours that please the palates.\n\nSea Bream Crudo with Espelette Chilli, Orange Ponzu Dressing is like sashimi prepared European style, and I love it. The raw fish is very fresh and its taste is perked up by the simulating flavours of the zesty ponzu and nuanced kick of the chilli. And I like the perfectly cut orange slices lol. They tastes good when dapped with a bit of the flavourful oil the sea bream is soaked in.\n\nNot lots of restaurants have courtyards, so I really like the courtyard of this restaurant, which gives a feeling like I'm in a mini castle or an exclusive party. Sitting at the porch and watching the world pass by across the courtyard and through the entrance is quite an experience. The interior is elegant, simple and modern with an open kitchen. And there is a long row of temperature controlled wine cabinet at the inner part of restaurant housing lots of different wines. I like sitting at the place where there are windows above me, for the different experience of sitting under windows yet still enjoying the comfort of air-conditioning and safety of the enclosure.\n\nThe service is outstanding, being very attentive, polite and thoughtful. This is a place I will think of when I want to enjoy great wine with great food.\n\nThoughts: Awesome Food, Wine, Service and Ambience"", 'date': '8 months ago', 'images': ['https://storage.googleapis.com/synthesis_geos_public/thumbnails/thumb_unavail.jpg']}]","{'tuesday': ['11:45:00', '14:00:00'], 'wednesday': ['11:45:00', '14:00:00'], 'thursday': ['11:45:00', '14:00:00'], 'friday': ['11:45:00', '14:00:00'], 'saturday': ['11:45:00', '14:00:00']}",Restaurant,https://storage.googleapis.com/synthesis_geos_public/thumbnails/thumb_ChIJ-6PObBcZ2jERouhn_cAZ3ik.jpg,Restaurant,Restaurant,4.354214607032316,,['cosy'],['groups'],,,['great_cocktails'],"['coffee', 'alcohol']",['card'],['accepts_reservations'],"['beer', 'wine', 'cocktails', 'hard_liquor']",['delivery'],,,0.0,7942

It seemed like the most logical choice in terms of price, value and taste.\n\nHowever, Wilson kept trying to dissuade us from getting the soup by stating it‚Äôd take 40 mins. Even though we made it clear that we were ok to have it later, and we were at the restaurant around 7.15pm.\n\nWe had to confirm that we understood the waiting time at least 4 to 5 times while ordering, which was annoying to say the least.\n\nWas it because that soup had the most value (~$65 for at least 5pax) compared to the other soups (~$50 to $80 for 1 pax)?? Don‚Äôt put it on the menu if you‚Äôre reluctant to let ppl order it!\n\nIt was very strange to have a waiter try to stop us that many times, especially since the dish is recommended on the menu.\n\nAlso, while ordering, Wilson cut us off multiple times and did not listen to what we were saying. We had to repeat that we were flexible on the order of the food as he seemed fixated on sending them in a specific order.\n\nThe service team as a whole also seems very disorganized as we were asked about our tea choice 4 times by 4 different ppl. Even though we had alr placed our order with the first staff. There should be a better system in place.\n\nFood-wise, the wasabi prawns (not pictured) were the best dish of the night. But not enough to save the awful service at the start.\n\nMost of the food went downhill from there:\n- Smoked jasmine tea pork ribs(?)had no smoked/jasmine tea flavor, although it was tender.\n- Fried rice was bland and sad.\n- Double boiled kampong chicken soup(?) was also too simple and bland, although I understand they are trying to keep the flavors pure. It just wasn‚Äôt rich or complex enough, and mainly tasted of pepper. The saving grace was the chicken from the soup, which they shredded for us; tender and tasty.\n- Kailan was small and bitter\n\nThey had a unique selection of desserts, with the maotai ice cream making the strongest impression. The scoop is small, and the ice cream tastes like whisky. Worth trying once.\n\nThe coconut pudding is also innovative with its use of popping candy and boba. Don‚Äôt bother getting the pu er lychee jelly, as it doesn‚Äôt even taste like dessert (was recommended by another staff). Very bland, perhaps because it was paired with the other desserts.\n\nTo be honest, the service was so bad at the start that Madame Fan felt irredeemable. But another staff, Kent (in a white shirt), saved the experience with his polite and conscientious service.\n\nCompared to the rest of the staff, he was very active in checking on the tea levels at different tables and prompt in clearing the dishes.\n\nAnyway, doubt we‚Äôd be back. We were wowed by the ambience while researching this place online, and were even considering it for our wedding.\n\nDefinitely felt like we dodged a bullet with the mostly terrible service and average food.\n\nCanton Paradise trumps Madame Fan in almost every aspect except decor.

The fish was fresh and the vinegered Hijiki Seaweed Rice with various pickles were the perfect accompaniment.\n-Honey Miso Broiled Black Cod also served on a Hoba leaf , was just as fresh with a good balance of both sweetness and savouriness from the honey and miso. Hijiki rice and pickles were also served with the cod.\n-Grilled Mushroom Swiss Burger had a nice juicy patty of beef which came with a big portion of fries.\n\nDesserts were delicious to say the least :\n- Coconut Panna Cotta was creamy and this was balanced by the tartness from the mangoes and passion fruit\n- Traditional Kaiserschmarrn a fluffy sweet pancake with rum soaked raisins and powdered sugar. This came with a plate of cut strawberries and strawberry ice cream. An order is meant for 2.\n-Sticky Toffee Pudding served with mascarpone ice cream was not too sweet but the toffee was a tad too savoury.\n\nBeware of the warm mushroom bread and sourdough bread.

Their blink-and-you‚Äôll-miss-it doorway tucked in a discreet corner of Raffles Hotel Shopping Arcade belies the world beyond it - a sushi sanctuary for want of better words. The dining experience is beautiful and quite otherworldly, to say the least. My friend Vijay and I went for the Chef‚Äôs Omakase ($500++ per pax) that night and Chef-owner @k.oshino served us a goblet of Shijimi freshwater clams soup to warm our bellies before launching straight into what he is most revered for, his sushi.\nA shockingly refined piece of Hirame (flounder) led the way. It had me gasping but before I could catch my breath, a Yellowjack came along and left me equally shook.\nChef Oshino then placed an elegant stand bearing Shiro Ebi (white shrimp) with Caviar, Aka Uni from Kyushu and Bafun Uni from Hokkaido in front of the each of us. I savoured that trio in quiet bliss.\nIka (squid) generally leaves me cold, but the white beauty I was presented with, dressed understatedly in salt and Japanese lime, had me longing for more.\nA most astonishing Kinmedai came after, before the first streak of silver of the evening, a Kohada, arrived. I made both vanish in a flash.\nThen, temperatures shifted with the arrival of a Hokkaido Hairy Crab baked with miso - I adored how the savouriness heightened the crustacean‚Äôs sweetness.\nA school of ‚ÄúGlass Fish‚Äù from Hokkaido swam up next. Soft and slippery, they tasted of seaweed to me but like Vijay noticed, with a bitter finish.\nThe sushi continued with a stellar Sawara (Spanish mackerel) before another silver-scaled piece struck again - it was a delectably strong Iwashi (sardine) that bounced me up to cloud nine.\nThe following course consisted of Pen Shell, Ark Shell, Japanese Barracuda, very deliciously dressed Saury and Chutoro, and was as indulgent as it was divine.\nOne of my top three sushi from the meal was served at this point - the Aji (horse mackerel). I was so eager to eat it, I actually forgot to take a photo! Shocking, right? üòÇ\nAnyway, sailing in after that momentary booboo was a fantastic Uni Gunkan, in all its cold, creamy magnificence.\nAutumn‚Äôs gorgeous colours were captured in the triple threat of Oyster, Abalone and Ankimo (monkfish liver). Premium ingredients exactingly prepared to ensure immense satisfaction.\nMoments later came the Shimofuri, a choice cut of the fatty tuna belly which melted in the mouth like I knew it would.\nTopped with yuzu zest, Chef @k.oshino‚Äôs marinated tuna retained the texture of fish flesh and was not as smooth as other versions I‚Äôve tried. Not saying which is better - just appreciating their differences üòã.\nThe Kawahagi (Leatherjacket) boasted the best accessory - its own liver. Suffice to say, we swooned over this.\nStraight from the fryer flew the Matsutake Mushroom and ginkgo nuts. They were piping hot and tasty.\nFor our palate cleanser, we each received a fresh Japanese Gooseberry to munch. How clever and perfect, is it not?\nThen, a mini ricebowl with Ikura so fresh, my teeth felt like they were popping bubble wrap! The confetti of yuzu zest was a brilliant touch.\nI was blindsided by the Scallop sushi. Wow, wow, wow - truly bowled over by the mouthfeel and taste it delivered.\nThe sweet and springy-fleshed Kuruma Ebi (Japanese Tiger Prawn) in the second mini ricebowl was absolutely delicious as well.\nProving yet again its ability to stop conversations was the beguilingly smoky and oily-rich Nodoguro, the last piece of sushi in Chef‚Äôs Omakase.\nOur final savoury course though was a superb Tuna Cheek Shabu Shabu served with ponzu and yuzu kosho. Although it looked clean and clear, the soup had remarkable depth and flavour thanks to the fattiness of the fish. I couldn‚Äôt get enough of this!\nTamago - the edible punctuation that‚Äôs dropped in before dessert at such meals, showed up right on time. Chef‚Äôs version was bold in savouriness with a hint of sweet.\nWe finished with seasonal fruit from Japan.

While the restaurant had been recommended to me by a friend, my experience fell far short of my expectations.\n\nPros:\n\nAmbience: The restaurant's ambience was pleasant, with traditional Chinese decor that added a touch of elegance to the dining experience.\n\nChinese Cuisine Variety: Grand Shanghai offers a wide range of Chinese dishes, promising an extensive selection of flavours and culinary experiences.\n\nCons:\n\nUnwelcoming Reception: My visit began on the wrong foot when the front desk Chinese lady did not make any effort to guide me to my reserved table, even though it was my first time there. This lack of attention made me feel unwelcome and lost.\n\nInconsistent Service: As our food was served, I noticed that some guests at adjacent tables were left waiting for their orders. It was disappointing to witness the lack of consistency in serving the food promptly to all customers. We had to repeatedly call over the waitress to remind them to serve the missing portions, which disrupted our dining experience.\n\nLack of Attention: The waitstaff's attentiveness was notably lacking throughout the evening. For instance, they failed to refill the teapot with hot water, even when we turned the lid upside down as a signal. This neglect of basic service elements hindered our enjoyment of the meal.\n\nIn conclusion, my first visit to Grand Shanghai Restaurant in Singapore was not as enjoyable as I had hoped. The restaurant's beautiful decor and variety of Chinese dishes are overshadowed by the unwelcoming reception, inconsistent service, and a lack of attention from the waitstaff.

It overlooks an open area on the rooftop.\n\nInterior is spacious with plenty of seatings for big and small groups. They also have a private dining room but take note there is a minimum spending amount.\n\nWe ordered quite a variety of dishes here:\n\nSoups\n1) Double-boiled Collagen Soup with Fish Maw and Conpoy\n2) Whole Coconut Combination - Braised Hot and Sour Broth\n\nFor the soups we were really disappointed. The collagen soup had a very fishy smell and taste which we did not appreciate. The braised hot and sour broth was very starchy and not to our liking. I would not recommend these 2 soups.\n\nMains\n1) Steamed Free-range Salted Chicken ""Hakka Style""\n2) Sauteed Sliced Kurobuta Pork with Broccoli in Homemade XO sauce\n3) Braised Eggplant with Minced Pork in Spicy Sauce\n4) Wok-Fried Live Sri Lankan Crab with Pan-fried Cheong Fun in Chef\'s Special Pork Lard Sauce\n\nFor the mains I would not recommend the chicken at all. We struggled to finish it. It was meh. Would recommend Soup Restaurant chicken over this chicken any day.\n\nThe kurobuta was ok but the broccoli was cooked perfectly and we loved it with the sauce. The braised eggplant was super yummy. My family loved that as well as the cheong fun.\n\nI would say among the mains my favourite was the crab cheong fun. Exceptionally tasty and the wok hey on it was legit. Would definitely be back for more of that!\n\nDessert\n1) Chilled Mango Cream topped with Vanilla Ice Cream and Oats served in Coconut\n2) Hot Yam Paste with Gingko Nuts and Coconut Milk\n3) Chilled Peach Resin with Osmanthus and Aloe Vera Jelly\n4) Deep-fried Chinese Pancake filled with Red Bean Paste\n\nThe yam paste was ok. The pancake with red bean was alright. But the highlight for us when it came to desserts were no. 1 and 3.\n\nThe chilled mango cream with vanilla ice cream and oats is a combination that I have not tried before but somehow it really works. It was amazing. Everything just came really well together and the acidity of the mango is balanced by the vanilla ice cream. I would highly recommend this for dessert!\n\nThe peach resin with osmanthus and aloe was a perfect end to the meal. Very refreshing and fragrant. This is more like what you would find in chinese restaurants but elevated due to the addition of osmanthus. Since the previous dessert was slightly heavier it was nice to end off on a lighter note.\n\nIn summary there are really good dishes here. Bill came up to 400+ for 3 people so it is on the pricier side for a meal here but definitely worth a try on a special occasion.', 'date': '2 months ago', 'images': ['https://storage.googleapis.com/synthesis_geos_public/thumbnails/thumb_unavail.jpg']}, {'rating': 4, 'description': 'Came for lunch with colleagues. the area was easy to locate.

Little did I know that I was about to embark on what would turn out to be my most delightful dining experience in Singapore.\n\nAs a devoted food enthusiast and someone who enjoys Michelin starred restaurants, I must assert that this culinary gem deserves more accolades than the prestigious star it has already earned.\n\nPerched on the 6th floor of the National Gallery Singapore, the restaurant offers a panoramic view of the city skyline and Marina Bay through its floor-to-ceiling windows. Before entering, I took a moment to relax on the expansive terrace, basking in the glory of a breathtaking sunset.\n\nBeing the first guest of the evening, I was greeted with warmth and attention from the entire team. Mr. Pellegrino, the Restaurant Manager, graciously welcomed me and led me to a cozy table by the window.\n\nThe interior exuded elegance and sophistication, showcasing natural materials and contemporary design. The neutral palette of white, beige, and gray, coupled with wooden and leather furnishings, created a refined ambiance. Tables adorned with crisp white linen, exquisite chinaware, and Riedle crystal glasses added to the overall allure.\n\nOpting for a bubbly start, I perused a delightful selection of champagnes presented by the sommelier. My choice, the Egly-Ouriet - Les Pr√©mices Brut, proved to be a light-bodied and refreshing champagne with hints of white fruit, citrus, and minerals.\n\nThe aperitif was a culinary journey in itself. From the ""Chutoro tonnato with Japanese strawberry,"" a tender delight paired with fresh strawberries, to the creative reinterpretation of ""Prosciutto e Melone"" with swordfish ham and melon, and finally, a tiny puff with stracchino fondue and spring truffle sprinkles ‚Äî each bite was a revelation of flavors.\n\nThe official dinner commenced with the intriguing ""Cappone Magro,"" a dish traditionally enjoyed during Lent, skillfully reimagined by Chef Sperindio. The presentation was a work of art, featuring Alpine milk whipped into a cream infused with Alaskan and Sri Lankan king crab, chamomile, pear, and crowned with Majestic Black Caviar.\n\nThe pasta course, Taglierini with Santa Margherita prawns and Sancho pepper, paired seamlessly with Zyme\'s ""From Black To White, Il Bianco 2019,"" a rich and complex white wine suggested by Federico, the General Manager.\n\nContinuing the culinary voyage, ""Estate ad Albenga"" brought the taste of Liguria with a Mozambique Langoustine, Sardinian seabass, avocado, and celery pearls, topped with a chic emulsion of Franciacorta wine and beluga caviar.\n\nThe meat course, accompanied by Quintarelli Giuseppe\'s Valpolicella Classico Superiore 2016, showcased the chef\'s expertise with low-temperature cooked New Zealand Maimoa lamb, toasted chicken skin, and a warm Marsala reduction.\n\nDesserts were a symphony of flavors, with a pre-dessert of glazed Nashi pear and bergamot Pernod jelly, paired with Marsala Superiore ""Old John"" Riserva DOC 1998. The grand finale, ""Tourists on Mount Vesuvio,"" featured white chocolate, buffalo milk gelato, and a 40-year aged balsamic vinegar infusion.\n\nThe Piccola Pasticceria, a delightful array of pastries, concluded the feast, accompanied by Recioto della Valpolicella.\n\nIn essence, dining at Art is a poetic experience. The restaurant, paying homage to Pellegrino Artusi\'s ""The Science of Cooking and Art of Eating,"" seamlessly blends modern sensibilities with classic inspirations. The elegant interior, meticulous tableware, and the highly skilled team contribute to a luxurious dining affair.\n\nChef Sperindio\'s culinary storytelling, from creative amuse-bouches to hearty main courses, immerses diners in his world. Art offers an innovative, authentic, and elegant dining experience that leaves patrons both satisfied and inspired.\n\nIf you seek a culinary adventure that transcends the ordinary, Art is undoubtedly the place for you.', 'date': '2 days ago', 'images': ['https://storage.googleapis.com/synthesis_geos_public/thumbnails/thumb_unavail.jpg']}, {'rating': 5, 'description': 'A wonderful birthday lunch - thanks to the pleasant, attentive and warm service.

The pasta was cooked al dente, and the sauce was superb. You are tempted to take in every last drop.\n\nThe USDA prime ribs were full of flavour and served medium rare so the tenderness was spot-on.\n\nGave 4 stars rather than 5 as although most of the staff were very friendly and genuine, there were 2 who gave off a snooty vibe. Granted they managed to say the right words, but the expression and tone of voice were incongruent. This made the experience less pleasant each time they came over with the next course. The staff we met at the front (two females) and the younger servers were really friendly and welcoming.\n\nThe dessert could also have been better - the pistachio gelato was nice but that candied fruit and sheep ricotta mousse was subpar.', 'date': 'a year ago', 'images': ['https://storage.googleapis.com/synthesis_geos_public/thumbnails/thumb_unavail.jpg']}, {'rating': 5, 'description': ""I had always wanted to go to Gattopardo since this is the only place to get Sicilian food, and it is always exciting and sometimes very rewarding to try out a new type of cuisine. Since Sicily is an autonomous island near Italy, the cuisine has noticeable Italian and Mediterranean influences, okay, this looks really promising. After a Sicilian Journey here, I can say I'm now a fan of Sicilian cuisine.\n\nA taste of Sea Scallop Ceviche, Smoked Caviar makes one feels like he or she is dining in a beautiful seaside town. This is such a beautiful dish, in terms of both aesthetic and taste. The fresh, plump, juicy scallops is so full of briny sweetness, accentuated by the intense umami of smoked caviar, zest of the tomato and clear sauce. I love this so much.\n\nBunny Kombucha of Passion Fruit flavour is very refreshing, slightly sweet and sour. Great for the health of the guts and really whets the appetite. Very good recommendation by the friendly and helpful service staff.\n\nAmuse Bouche of Truffle with Ricotta Cheese has the super creaminess and mild nutty flavour of ricotta cheese paired with the earthy aroma of truffle. The thin wafer adds a nice crunch to the dish. A well-executed starter that explores the combination of various tastes and textures.\n\nSourdough bread is served warm and has a nice fluffy texture Very wholesome treat, and the olive is very interesting in taste, having a slight astringent bitter taste with planty notes. I like this unique taste.\n\nSicilian Rice Balls, Fresh Black Truffle, Ragusano Cheese Fondue comes after Scallop Ceviche, and this is like trip from the seaside to the deep woods. More mellow, features the nuanced flavours of the earth and woods, this dish is a nice transition in taste profile. The fluffy, starchy rice packed with molten cheese, peppered with truffle, is so wholesome in taste.\n\nRisone Pasta, Baby Octopus, Bone Marrow Butter is another great surprise served. The baby octopus is springy in texture and yet easy to bite, I definitely prefer this over the regular tough octopus. I love the Risone Pasta. It has the wholesomeness of quality rice, and its grain-like shape allows the rich sauce to fully coat each grain, so each bite of this is bursting with flavours. The texture of this paste is unique and unbelievably good, having smooth exterior with starchy interior. First time ti try to kind of pasta, and I'm lovin' it already.\n\nThe service staff is very nice to change my mains to Citrus Glazed Iberico Pork Belly, Parsnip, Wild Spinach from the lunch menu since I prefer pork and seafood over beef, lamb and fish. This has nice tender pork with rich gamey flavours, and mustard and special sauce to cut through the gamey flavours for the balance in taste. Very favourful and hearty.\n\nTiramisu, Noto Almonds, Amaretti Crumble is a indulgent treat with lots of creaminess, hints of alcohol and nutty goodness of almonds. This nicely round up the whole exciting trip of a meal.\n\nThe place is so beautiful. The exterior looks like a well-furnished bungalow with a courtyard. The first floor is seeped in idyllic theme, like the backyard patio of a mansion, perfect to chill out. The second floor is posh and fancy, like the main dining hall of the very same mansion. Lots of instagram-worthy pictures can be taken of the place. The service is excellent, being friendly, enthusiastic and attentive, and they have very good knowledge of the food. Now I can add another favourite type of cuisine into my Favourites List, and it is Sicilian. Since it is in my Favourites List, of course, I will come back for more.\n\nThoughts: I love all dishes here.

It gives you the feeling of being included in the process of their art, yet it still also feels intimate. I was lucky to have one of the seats at the counter to directly watch the talented cooks work their magic. Amazing Artwork shown here as well. It really balances traditional elements with rebel culture art. I adored the music they chose - it was a mixture of pop classics and some indie songs and consists of the favourite songs of the chef. For me personally it made the whole experience feel extremely personal as it was a pretty good match to my own spotify favorites. Loved it, we need more of this instead of the run-of-the-mill classical stuff.\n\nFood: Officially eight courses but a variety of snacks was also offered. The menu had a very good progression overall and was bursting with flavour. I especially loved the quirky combos - licorice bread, artichoke or laksa leaf ice cream. The coconut broth that came with the lobster course was just a warm, heartfelt culinary hug.\n\nDrinks: Although i started with some bubbly I opted for the nonalcoholic pairing - this was also one of the main reasons for having chosen Cloudstreet. The pairing made sense to me with highlights being the pairing for the Wagyu and the smoke on the water.\n\nService: As you would expect from a two star restaurant. Everyone was very professional and eager to make my experience as smooth as possible. There was one hiccup when they sent me the alcoholic beverage pairing instead of the nonalcoholic pairing for the dessert. For me it is not a big issue, however I guess someone who cannot drink alcohol for health or religious reasons might take more offense to that. But mistakes happen and I probably should have also noticed that the drink is not non-alcoholic when it was presented. Everything else was absolutely impeccable.\n\nAttitude: I went to Cloudstreet by myself and the team took such great care of me. I was a little apprehensive to go to a fine dining restaurant by myself, but they made me feel very welcome and included.

The staff guided us to this room with three tables and we occupied one of them. After that, this group of around 12-14 people came in and started chattering very loudly. We requested to change tables since the noise was deafening but the staff did not allow us to. Their reasoning was that the other tables were reserved. I do not understand their reasoning because: 1. There were many other tables that were empty so why should we have been confined to that room? 2. From the time we entered to the time we left, the restaurant was at 50% capacity only. There was no reason as to why they couldn't have let us go to a table outside.\n\nAnother instance that left us totally stumped was when we ordered our food earlier than the other table in the room. However, the other table got their food first and although we waited for while longer, we still didn't get any food served to us. As such, one of my companions went to ask the staff why our food was taking so long and their response was quite hilarious. As the other table had ordered appetisers and we did not, we would be served later even though we had ordered our food earlier. I will refrain from saying any expletives but my companions and I were basically hungry and tired from their nonsense.\n\nIn total, we waited for 35mins for our food. That's too long of a waiting time when there weren't even that many tables occupied!\n\nFor the food, it was disappointing. It totally did not match up with the high prices we paid for it.

It would be good if the service staff could have indicated where I can place my bulky bag somewhere. A group which arrived, seated and ordered after us, were served both alcohol and starters before us. Apparently, the staff forgot our order. I had to tell the drink staff that I ordered a cocktail before he proceeded the make one for me. They only started serving us our food after we reminded them that we have ordered. All these time, we were just looking at the groups beside us digging into their food. Mind you, it‚Äôs a small service of only 11-12 pax at the counter. How is it even possible to forget a customer‚Äôs order?\n\nCorn ribs were surprisingly good albeit salty. Beef tartare was seasoned well but the pieces were roughly chopped. I had a few pieces which were too big. Presentation wise and from the diner‚Äôs perspective, the tartare can‚Äôt be seen. It‚Äôs hidden under the plain big piece of appalam. I would have preferred the appalam to be served at the side instead and not being advised to smash it with a spoon, where we ended up having uneven sized pieces to pair with the tartare. The famed bibimmyeon was pre-mixed, refrigerated and hand plated upon order. It had a bitter aftertaste and not the refreshing tangy spicy flavour profile you would have expected from a bibimmyeon. Prawn Pajeon though fried till crispy was more like a chive pajeon with prawn pieces placed atop. Sothi dipping sauce could be slightly more acidic to cut the greasiness of the fried pajeon. Pork rib though seasoned and grilled well was more American flavoured than Korean or Indian. No mention about water being charged by the bottle. The service staff was just overly enthusiastic in filling up our half-filled glasses with water and I only realised we were charged $10 for 2 bottles of water during payment when we didn‚Äôt even drink that much. Would have helped if the service staff could have kindly asked us if we needed more water and he can open another bottle of chargeable water for us.\n\nI felt that the staff were just rushing through the service (get this over and done with attitude) and not sincere and passionate about in presenting a new form of fusion food.

Not a typical fine dinning setting but more of a simple sit down dinning for a close group of friends to meet up and chat over a hearty meal.\n\nThe restaurant serves some of the more classical French dishes such as foil gras and escargot, with choices of either cold or warm appetisers dishes. It seems the white asparagus is in season now and we ordered 1/2 dozen of escargots and the foie gras (served with toasted country bread) to go with it for our starters.\n\nThe escargot was baked with parsley and garlic butter. Classical proven dish that couldn‚Äôt really go wrong, but nothing outstanding either. Felt that the escargots was a tad over baked for me as the meat was slightly tough. Overall the taste was rich and flavourful, and the leftover butter oil makes great dip for the bread. 3/5\n\nThe white asparagus was served with Parma ham, Benedict eggs and hollandaise sauce. The asparagus was crunchy and juicy, and would have paired perfectly with the savoury ham, if not for the lingering bitter vegetal aftertaste coming from the asparagus. Not sure what the Benedict egg and hollandaise sauce bring to the dish, didn‚Äôt think the sauce went well with the dish. 3/5\n\nThe foie gras serving was generous! Some of the inferior foie gras I tasted had a powdery and crumbly texture with a strong metallic iron aftertaste lingering. But the foie gras served here was of a much higher quality. Smooth and buttery with a right proportion of fat; lighter in taste but yet flavourful (from the meat) and rich without being too overpowering. It left you wanting to try more as it didn‚Äôt have the saturating greasy feeling. The yellow portion of the foie gras in the picture was actually solidified fat and simply pure decadent! I would strongly encourage everyone to at least try a small bit of it to savour the slow melting of pure animal fat essence in your mouth! The reddish condiment at the side was some sort of dried fruit puree and the slight sweet-sourness went very well with the savoury foie gras. The only disappointment I had with the dish was the hard country bread, but otherwise excellent dish. 4.5/5\n\nWe ordered 3 mains for sharing:  lamb tongue (not in regular menu), beef tartare and ribeye steak\n\nPersonally I prefer my lamb to be grilled for that rich ‚Äúmuttony‚Äù favour. This lamb tongue was stewed and served on top of potato mash. I chose this main as lamb tongue was an interesting cut I had not tried before despite the cooking style. The meat was tender with a bit of chewiness to it. Taste was delicately light and I hardly get any ‚Äòmuttony‚Äô favour in it. This was a very nice dish albeit it didn‚Äôt suit my personal taste preference. 3.5/5, only because of personal taste preference, otherwise the dish deserved a 4.\n\nThe beef tartare was disappointing. I loved the Angus beef for its ‚Äòsashimi freshness quality‚Äô with a slight chewy texture. But the condiment was a tad overpowering from the pungent shedded onion and the overly tangy dressing. I felt that the taste was off balanced in the mouth, skewing more towards the condiment. Texture was good, chewiness of the meat went well with the onion crunchiness. The bread was disappointing hard. 3/5\n\nSaving the best for the last, the ribeye was the highlight of the meal for us. Perfectly grilled to medium rare with a pinkish tender center (an expected standard for any high end restaurant) and a slight crusty charred exterior. Decent fat content and the juice of the meat was well sealed during the cooking. Every mouthful was a fine balance of favour and texture. Tenderness of the meat interspersed with crispy charred parts, full bodied and juicy meat favour elevated by the light seasoning. It also went very well with the B√©arnaise sauce as it presented a different taste profile.

It melts quickly and pairs extremely well with the sweet jam and well toasted bread below. The parmesan and tapioca fritters were also really unique and something that I've not seen done elsewhere. The cheese hits hard so if you're a cheese lover, do give this a try. The chips and dip was nice to snack on and the staff were kind enough to offer a refill on the chips to finish up the leftover dip!\n\nI would say that the beef tongue sandwich is quite similar to a pastrami sandwich with a strong mustard sauce, except that the tongue is a lot more tender. The cavatelli was nice but it paled in comparison with the rest of the dishes we ordered as there was nothing too special about it that stood out.\n\nFor desserts we ordered the caramelized brioche which was really a great way to end off dinner. It was slightly too sweet for our palates. But the contrast between the warm bread and the cold semifreddo, the crunchy caramelized bits of bread and the airy texture of the coffee cream, do ensure you have the space for dessert if you're coming.\n\nService was really good with the head chef serving our dishes to us (we were seated right in front of the open kitchen).

Using trompe l‚Äôoeil to make it look like tomatoes it‚Äôs actually a soft shell with tomato gazpacho encased within. The scallop tartare with avocado and tomato jelly was wonderfully light with all the elements working in harmony. The cod mousse taco was nice but overshadowed by its two counterparts. The first course started with a bang, yellowtail finished table side with a horseradish snow. Light, refreshing and full of flavour with an added air of theatricality for good measure. The second course was Mozambique langoustine which was the highlight of the menu. Sitting on top of a creamy anchovy sauce. The sweetness of the langoustine was a perfect complement to the (not-too) salty sauce. While the gem lettuce added some crunch to contrast with the soft and plump shellfish. This course was pure delight from start to finish! The pasta course was an elevated carbonara which utilised cured egg yolk. It was not too heavy which was a pleasant surprise. The main was veal with white asparagus coated in sabayon in a moscato sauce. The veal was cooked to perfection and the kitchen, once again, demonstrate their attention to detail by ensuring that each dish consists of an equal balance of flavours and textures. The palate cleanser was finished table side with a prickly pear granita, highly refreshing after two somewhat heavier courses.

Previously where I thought the food was good, I wasn‚Äôt planning to return because of the disappointing service. This time, it was a whole new experience for us. Exactly like how we expect a luxurious Omakase to be. Service led by Jeffrey was on point, and they took note of our preference from our first dinner a month back. The food is still good though they could have done away with 1 dessert and substituted it with a good bowl of soup. Aside from this, the ume mojito cocktail from the bar was amazing! We appreciate that the Kisho team acknowledged our first experience was not representative of their brand and gave their best to make it a night to remember for both of us. I‚Äôm happy to amend this rating from a 2 to a solid 4, and we will be returning customers. Thank you! **\n\nThe good review first. Our appointment was at 7 however we were stuck in very bad traffic and we called to ask what‚Äôs the latest we could arrive. The lady over the phone told us before 8 since there is only one dinner seating and we were happy they waited for us. Location is beautiful and that kind of stirred our excitement for dinner as we‚Äôve had many magical Omakase experiences for lesser and we walked in with high hopes. The food was good overall, this was unfortunately the only saving grace of the night. It was a S$950 9 course Omakase meal for two (no sushi dishes at all), with underwhelming service that made the entire experience feel lacklustre.\nSomehow when we arrived, it felt oddly as though we were not welcome. Chef did not acknowledge us. The wait staff was unenthusiastic and the team made quite a few mistakes with our meals like adding wasabi when I had specifically requested not to have it anywhere on the plate, let alone on top of my dish. It was lovely that they allowed a second serving of bafun uni and miso soup as we were still hungry before the top up even though that dish was the last dish before desserts. It was my friend‚Äôs birthday and when the wait staff served the birthday dessert, she brought it in and left in on the table and walked off. No HBD greeting and no song. Wow. The lady at the payment  counter was just as disappointing. She did not ask us how we liked our dinner as she probably could sense our disappointment and yet did not bother to find out how they could have done better.\nI truly believe that stellar service can turn around a mediocre dining experience, however a Michelin standard in food is just lost in bad service. Everyone there did not appear to take pride in their work . There are smaller Omakase houses that aren‚Äôt so snobbish and provide beautiful service. There were many unoccupied seats and perhaps this in itself is telling.\nWe‚Äôd rather spend our hard earned money at places where they are actually genuinely happy to serve.

Part of our order was fairly simple. A neat single malt and a glass of Ros√©. The bar manager took our order and fulfilment was by a different person . The single malt arrived with ice and water and the glass of Ros√© wine never turned up. Had to remind the same bar manager abd finally it surfaced\n\nOur classic fries order , we were being served someone else‚Äôs sweet potatoes fries, which were on the same tray. Had to correct the server and extract our fries.\n\nThen for the first time saw a promotion offer on a trolley at Lantern. In my personal view such offers are best avoided in top ended bars as the person comes in and disturbs the flow of a conversation going on . However that was not the problem. The issue was you need to buy two glasses at the same time so then you end up with the second glass which would eventually be warm by the time you end up drinking the same. The bar manager again refused to serve the wines one after the other and insisted that both glasses of wine be placed at the same time\n\nThese are minor glitches and can easily be corrected by proper staffing and training to get the 3 to a 4.\n\nLuckily for me spotted two familiar faces, Mr Haizul and Anna, who thanks to their intervention brought the situation to control.\n\nGetting to 4 to 5 is simpler. Just by doing two things .\n\n1. Please DO NOT STOP the music for 30 minutes, if the adjacent corporate event is having speeches going on. Not fair to the other paying guests. Solution is pretty simple just allow a 10 minute speech .\n\n2. Also the Food menu requires a major makeover .\n\nGetting from a 5 to 6 would be to get a NEA cigar smoking licence for the open area at the side of the pool. üòÄüòÄ\n\nFinally, these are ALL minor irritants.

So when Bincho opened up again with Cloudstreet backing, we had to go.\n\nWhilst they serve a decent range of chicken cuts and grill the meat over charcoal Bincho do not skewer the meat.\n\nDoes that matter? Yes. Very much.\nA skewer is is constructed to give a specific surface area, meat to fat ratio and cleaned up to look enticing. But most of all, it‚Äôs an eating experience. Each stick prepared and served to you, bite sized and seasoned at the peak of its perfection.\n\nServing whole pieces reduces the whole experience. Bincho also serve seasonings (flavoured salts) next to almost every dish. For me this removes the chefs experience and skill and you run the risk of over seasoned bites with an over ambitious dip‚Ä¶\n\nMore issues with Bincho style:\n1. They slice the big cuts too thin, this ruins the textual difference you look for in Yakatori.\n2. They cook skin to chewy rather than crispy, this extenuates the fatty feeling.\n3. They rest the meat - normally a great thing as it makes it juicer. But for me it means the pieces come out cool and missing that exciting freshness you get from a stick freshly picked off the grill.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk price. The chicken cuts are priced reasonably ($8-24) as you get whole pieces or multiple items per plate.\n\nBut look across at the side dishes and plates you get an all together different feeling. We got one small salad (literally 2 baby courgette - smaller than my finger) and half a dozen leaves for $32! That‚Äôs unjustifiable.  Prices for single plates currently go up to $160!!! So you‚Äôd better bring a rich friend if you want to eat a balanced meal or try something a little different.\n\nPS: The ‚Äòcrispy rice ball‚Äô - The smallest rice ball I‚Äôve ever seen for $20 - you should also know, it‚Äôs covered in salmon, row and bottarga - maybe you see that as good value‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not what we expected, served with a thimble (half) full of soup.\n\nIf you‚Äôve read this far congratulations!

It may be very dependent on people taste, but I found my oysters were not fresh at all.

This is served as a delicate and finely-cut cube, which I believe everyone would expect there shouldnt be bones in it, let alone sticking out.\n\nI was disappointed at the time, and reported that to their waiter in a peaceful manner. I had no intention to fuss around at then as it could just be a careless mistake.\n\nBut the response I got is outrageous. I was told because it‚Äôs an eel, bone is expected to be in it. So, my understanding from them is why should I complain about it as fish always has bones. It might sounds fair, but as said it is a delicate and finely cut cube where removing bone should be part of the process and chef should make every possible effort to make sure of it. I cannot accept it is not seen as an oversight and i‚Äôm even more disappointed the chef and waiter thought it is ok.\n\nThe other dish (the so-called signature scallop), as a Michelin star restaurant, how can you not clean the plate before serving, leaving some oil drops splashing around it. It totally affected my dining experience.\n\nthroughout the evening, i have also witnessed waiter reminded their chef they have ingredients missed to include in their dishes.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice indeed. The decor, lighting, and overall aesthetic create a pleasant and inviting space for dining. It's an excellent place to enjoy a relaxed meal, and that alone contributes positively to the dining experience.\n\nMoreover, I found the staff to be quite helpful. They were attentive and willing to assist with menu recommendations and special dietary requests.

Had the opportunity to order the special promotion set E that comes with Signature Chili Crab, Saut√©ed Scallops in XO Chili Sauce, Char-grilled Kurobuta Pork Jowl, Braised Beancurd and Mushrooms in Truffle Sauce, Braised E-Fu Noodle in XO Chili Sauce, and comes with Yuzu jelly with Aloe Vera as the dessert of the day (Promotion set $188++/4pax). To ensure our party of 5 indulged fully, we added the promotional 2 crabs for $79++ (in black pepper sauce) We were blown away by the dishes! While we found the chili crab sauce was a bit too thick (and the black pepper sauce a bit too sweet and sticky) to our liking , the crabs were meaty, juicy and very fresh! The Scallops were generous in portion and size (and succulent!) , the noodles was delicious, and the braised beancurd and mushroom was amazing! (some restaurants tend to overdo it with their truffle sauces but TungLok Heen did it superbly!). The Kurobuta did not really take our attention due to the crabs on the table but it was also done perfectly - if they presented the Kurobuta before the crabs, i am pretty sure it would have dazzled us more as well). The portion is well balanced for 5 pax and is definitely a steal for the amount of seafoods and quality of the dishes delivered.

We saw that the sign said close so we signaled to the lady server. She just asked us to wait outside. That's fine as sometimes they need more time to get ready. What is weird is that there was already a table of 3 eating while we  waited 10 mins outside.\n\nGeneral Service\nService was pretty off point too.  For context, it was CNY but I don't think there were very packed during our meal. Servers were inattentive in details such as changing of plates, serving drinks. We left a dirty plate on the side table to see if they will come collect. From the second dish till we left, the plate was still there! We had to ask for them to refill the tea every single time.(we did wait for a while with the standard cap off the tea pot) and they don't serve the drinks at all. And one more example was the Nian gao before desert. As mentioned, our plates were not clear out in a timely fashion and the nian gao was served in a plate in the middle. I asked for a change of plate but the male lead server told me they don't change plate right before dessert. But he clearly can see that all our plates were not clean at all! He did clear the plates and gave us some clean ones but this is a weird one.\n\nSpeed of serving: We seemed to be in a mad rush. The table wasnt that big but the dishes just come fast and furious. We were having 2-3 large plates on our table most of the time.\n\nConclusion: If I paid $600 for the meal, I do expect the service to be much better than what I received.

Unfortunately, the experience was terrible and highly disappointing. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, and here\'s why.\n\nThe service was terrible from the moment we arrived. The waitresses did not greet us with a simple ""hello"" or even a smile. Instead, they served us and spoke to us in a manner which made us feel as if they were doing us a favor. The placement of the cutlery was far from discreet or professional, and it was clear that the waitress was on the verge of throwing the plates onto the table. This was similar to Karen Y.\'s Google review from five months ago, where she described the service as ""awful"" and ""rude.""\n\nTo add insult to injury, the restaurant team didn\'t seem to care about our order. We ordered one appetizer, one soup, and four main courses, but a main course arrived first. When we informed the waitress that we had ordered an appetizer and asked why the main course was served before the appetizer, she simply replied ""ÁÖÆÁöÑÊòØ‰∏çÂêåÁöÑÈÉ®Èó®"" (the chefs cooking the main course and appetizer are from different departments). We were asking ourselves at this point, were we supposed to enter the kitchen to inform the chefs after placing our order?\n\nThe drinks were another disaster. We ordered four bottles of Perrier at the start of the meal and two more bottles halfway through the meal when the first four had finished. The waitress brought over one chilled Perrier and then said ""Ê¨†‰Ω†‰∏ÄÁì∂"" (owe you one bottle). We figured that it was highly likely few people ordered Perrier, and they needed to fetch more from their store. And like what we assumed, the waitress brought over the remaining bottle un-chilled - without asking if we were fine with it being at room temperature or if we needed ice to go with it.\n\nBy this point, the variety of poor service was just getting more elaborate, and we were quite disappointed. The meal was supposed to celebrate my wife\'s birthday, and the service was affecting her mood. I asked to speak to the manager privately and subtly conveyed my displeasure. I explained that the poor service was affecting my family\'s experience and more importantly, the birthday celebrant\'s mood. But even after that, there was no service recovery done, not even an attempt.\n\nAfter looking at the reviews on Google, I regret just depending on the overall score and not researching more thoroughly by reading the recent and lowest reviews.

Anyway, better late than never.\n\nI‚Äôm all hyped up to try the food here the moment I saw its menu featuring Japanese Tapas, called Tapasu in Japanese Romanji. I like unique concept of Japanese food served in small plates so that I can try more menu items in one sitting. In addition, the food here is pretty unique, and of course yummy, so dining here is a worthwhile experience.\n\nThe interior of Ippai is that of modern, cool, upmarket Izakaya style. A great place to chill, get comfy, enjoy some good food with friends. And enjoy some sake while at it lol\n\nThe service is also very good and attentive. And they make some good recommendations on sake and food. In addition, it‚Äôs nice that they let me know of this ‚Äúone for one tapas‚Äù promotion so as to be kinder to my wallet üëçüèª\n\nThe very interesting Negitoro Cone is packed with so many ingredients, as evident from the photo, and so much flavours. Creaminess, umami, tangy zest, planty pungency all stuffing into the cute cones, whose crunchiness works very well to enhance the overall texture. I also love the thoughtfulness for wrapping the cones with paper.\n\nKurobuta Miso Yaki is pretty juicy with nice lightly charred exterior, and comes miso sauce and mayonnaise. A hearty nice treat to munch on.\n\nI love Ebi Tartar Yaki. This is my favourite of the night. Lightly seasoned with a dollop of tartar and a dose ofvflying fish roe, the subtle briny sweetness of the succulent prawns shines through and takes the centrestage.\n\nHotate Truffle Uni Ice-cream is so luxurious. The uni ice-cream at the centre is naturally sweet with a lace of umami. It‚Äôs coldness complements the scallop slices very well. It‚Äôs decadent and delicious, but the price is much steeper than that of other dishes.\n\nThere is interesting trio of sake pairing, and it's for twenty bucks only. Super value for money.\n\nBesides the items I had tried, here are lots of other unique dishes in the menu. I want to try them too!\n\nBy the way, this restaurant serves Don sets instead during lunch.

My child wanted to see the cars on the road from the glass panels. I quickly brought my child out of the room (he just wanted to see the vehicles on the road). But the manager (wearing a beige suit), who looked really cheesed off, told his staff within earshot in Cantonese, to shut the door to the guest room.

I would ask the restaurant to increase the portion of the cucumber and spring onion for guests as it was not enough for the number of skin from the duck. The hoisin sauce was delicious and accompanied the duck perfectly. The skin was just a regular egg skin which you can purchase from the grocery stall easily. The steamed fish was very fresh and definitely must applaud the restaurant on the quality of the fish. I do find the stir fried Kai lan quite hard though and least enjoyable of all dishes. I would say the fried mee pok with duck meat was very enjoyable and unique as mee pok is not a dish you would be able to find as a stir fried fish easily. The mango pudding was good and not too sweet. I would not need to add in the evaporated milk as it was good as it came in.\n\nOne main issue I found with the dishes is the cracker which came with the duck.

The dessert was a good bonus - absolutely loved all the desserts and will order the next time I'm back, even if I'm not having the buffet.\n\nPortion sizes were very inconsistent, we came in a group of 5 pax, when we ordered 1 serving of dishes, some came in a 5 pax serving while others in a 1pax serving. Suggest to standardize to 1pax serving so we can try a larger variety of food, and minimize wastage. Same for the dessert, menu clearly states Á≤í and ‰Ωç but you guys still got it wrong and came with so many ice cream balls.\n\nOverall we still enjoyed our meal. Do take note no takeaways allowed for buffets even for food items with fixed portions (chilli crab, etc), and the 90mins timing is strict - once you exceed the time limit the QR code will expire and you won't be able to order more.

Not super flavourful but lends an additional chocolate flavour and was a good accompaniment\n\nWhat I wasn't a fan of was the frosting; it didn‚Äôt feel chocolatey enough. It was also stiff, but not much of a downside because the cake + sauce was so good as is.\n\nOverall really liked the cake, only complaint is with the frosting, but that itself isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker.\n\nSticky toffee pudding:\nI loved the sauce and ice cream. The sauce had the perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness and flavour. The ice cream itself was flavourful and right level of sweetness as well. Not overpowering nor too mild, it was just right.\n\nThe cake was steamed so it was moist etc, but I felt the flavour could use a little work. It was tasty with the sauce don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I felt that it could be improved if they put more dates to bump the date flavour. The texture was otherwise on point.\n\nOverall it was really good together, my only issue was with the cake on its own. It could have been more flavourful.

Based on personal preference, I feel I get the highest satisfaction-to-dollar value from their Omakase. Since I‚Äôd tried the $180++ option for lunch previously, I decided to indulge in the $250++ last Saturday. To say I was extremely pleased with my decision is an understatement, because everything Chef @sushi_ohno served was ultra delicious:\n1. Bonito -  Spectacular opener as the tuna creation with ponzu sauce, radish sprouts, ginger flower and shiso flower was bouquet-like in its burst of fragrance and flavour.\n2. Tai - The bouncy-fleshed red snapper was accompanied by seaweed salt and fresh wasabi. Chef encouraged us to eat the fish with and without the salt - both ways were really lovely.\n3. Iwashi Maki - Sardines, pickles and more, but no rice, were pressed together into the most gorgeous and mouthwatering roll.\n4. Kinmedai - Shockingly good! The straw-smoked fish was presented with wakame and a paste made from shiso leaf, spring onion and ginger. Definitely one of the standouts for me from the lunch.\n5. Hotaru Ika - Another favourite of mine. If you‚Äôve been scrolling through Instagram in the past month, you‚Äôd have  probably seen the firefly squid popping up on some foodies‚Äô Stories. Chef Ohno put a satay spin on it by threading a trio on a skewer.\n6. Baby Ayu - A pair of the freshwater fish swam up next. To be eaten whole, these were a divine textural experience of crunch and creaminess.\n7. Baby Snapper - Chef Ohno said that because the flesh of this fish is a bit sweet, he adds his own savoury shrimp powder to balance it out. Genius.\n8. Sakura Masu - I am not exaggerating when I say the piece of very soft cherry trout melted in the mouth most pleasurably.\n9. Zuke - The marinated lean tuna may have been on the salty side but the shari (vinegar-seasoned sushi rice) was strong enough to hold its own.\n10. Chutoro - I‚Äôve always believed one of the most beautiful sights at a sushi-ya, and also one of the most insanely delicious things to come from the ocean must be the medium-fatty tuna. This was a prime example.\n11. Otoro - Even fattier than the chutoro, it had a meatiness that made me think of an insanely tender steak.\n12. Akagai - I gawked at Chef Ohno as he ‚Äúwashed‚Äù each large clam in a bowl of vinegar and ice before forming sushi with it. The reason for this, he explained, is to neutralise its innate sweetness. Clearly, it worked as the result was terrific.\n13. Kohada - Firm and crunchy, the silvery gizzard shad with its bolder taste, was offset beautifully by the strong shari.\n14. Mini Chirashi Don - Each bowl was filled with a generous amount of uni, ikura, small pieces of flounder, prawn powder, mushrooms and kampyo. Best way to enjoy it was to push the spoon all the way down, so a little of everything was captured as the spoonful made its way up to the mouth.\n15. Kuruma Ebi - Usually cut into half for ladies, I requested Chef Ohno to serve my Japanese Tiger prawn whole. All the better to relish.\n16. Anago - Having been smoked between bamboo leaves, the warm conger eel was as bewitching in scent as it was in taste and texture.\n17. Ankimo and Kampyo Maki - Bringing up the rear, two small rice rolls. One contained monkfish liver that‚Äôd been steamed in sake, the other, strips of dried calabash gourd. Quite sensibly, I chased the rich with the crunchy when gobbling them.\n18. Tamago - Heard there‚Äôs prawn used in @Sushimieda‚Äôs version.  No wonder it‚Äôs complex and more umami than sweet.\n19. Dessert - Japanese strawberries, sliced apple, azuki red bean and salted caramel ice-cream brought lunch to a satisfying close.\n\nHow do you know when I genuinely LOVE a restaurant?

I'm totally impressed since I enjoy the complete set of classic French hospitality here: complimentary Bread with French butter, the Canap√©s, the pouring of sauces over the dishes in front of the patrons (I miss this nice little gesture so much, my last experiences with this were at Odette and French restaurants of such caliber many years ago), the French palate cleanser and the Petit Fours.\n\nBest of all, I get to enjoyed these without costing an arm or a leg. And yes, lots of videos ensured to capture the pouring of sauces. Feel free to request the friendly and patient staff to hold on for a while while getting the video mode ready. By the way, the service here is exceptional. It really takes me to the days of dining at classic French restaurants that achieve perfection in service.\n\nThe setting of the restaurant is contemporary and classy, with the colour white as main theme. I can really feel that I'm in a fancy French restaurant here (the French songs playing in the background helps with that), but without the dining-is-serious-business vibe due to the modern feel of the place. So I feel very ease here actually and loving it lol\n\nThe real show begins when Le Crabe is served. The rich-in-flavours ingredients really work their magic here. Briny fresh crab, buttery n grassy avocado and refreshingly, mildly sweet balsamic sorbet work so well together. I love this creamy treat.\n\nThe awesome dining journey continues with La Saint-Jacques. The seared succulent plump Hokkaido scallop has this amazing pan seared surface that is slightly crispy and carries an iota of smokiness, Butternut squash pur√©e adds the earthy sweetness while Parma ham introduces bits of excitement into the taste.\n\nLychee granita is one of the best palate cleansers I have. I love the sweet floral taste of lychee and the minuscule bites of lychee gives a nice variation in texture.\n\nLe Baba is oh-so-good. In fact, I heard the patrons at a neighbouring table swooning over this.\n\nThe service staff will slice the baba cake in half in front of the patrons. And the cake actually jiggle a bit when the knife slice through it: a testimony to how fluffy it is. And a look at the interior proves it. Next comes the Bailey's. The staff will enquire on the preferred amount of Bailey's to be added prior to adding it in. Lastly, the generous amount of light and fresh creamy Vanilla cream is added onto the Baba. This hits the right spot in both taste and texture. The cream and the tart taste of passionfruit glaze juxtapose so well with the herbal bitterness of Bailey's.\n\nThis is a must-try here.\n\nI'm really surprised by how intricate the dining experience here, and I feel so pampered when dining here. By the way, there is no dress code, so one can enjoy fine French food in a relaxing ambience and clothing. This is one of the places I will recommend to experience the full extent of French dining while not over-stressing the wallet.\n\nThoughts: Lovely French Restaurant for Indulgence"", 'date': '6 months ago', 'images': ['https://storage.googleapis.com/synthesis_geos_public/thumbnails/thumb_unavail.jpg']}, {'rating': 4, 'description': 'Service - top notch.

Our jaw dropped when after 20 minutes, only one basket of dim sum was served.  It took an additional 10 minutes to deliver a separate second plate of radish cake.

It's really great for sharing.\n\nTwisted Mac, Chicken & Cheese üßÄ\nExtremely kid friendly dish for those who are picky eaters. I really love how fun the long twisted cavatappi pasta is and that it's so generously coated with four cheese and some bell peppers. Chicken breast is rather tough, but not dry and stringy at all. The addition of lightly toasted bread on the side goes so well when you dip it in the creamy pasta sauce. Overall, it is a very carby cheesy dish that is very filling.\nI rate: 4/5 üåü\n\nOriginal Legendary Burger üçî was pretty good as well. I really enjoyed the Cajun fries on the side as well. The onion ring in the burger was thick, and the batter was light and crispy. The whole burger was very substantial and flavourful. The only confusing bit for me was why it was called a Fresh Steak Burger when the meat was a minced meat patty. ü´¢ Was kinda looking forward to biting into a piece steak.\nI rate: 4/5 üåü\n\nOne night in Bangkok Crispy Shrimps üç§ wasn't really as loud as the name. Quite mediocre with small crispy shrimps coated in light batter and drizzled with some tangy creamy sauce. There is coleslaw under the shrimps as well. Price point wise to taste, I'd rather pay for another main. I'm not really sure where the Bangkok name comes in terms of flavour.\nI rate: 1/5 üåü\n\nOther than the food, I really like the vibe of this place.
